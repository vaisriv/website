# About Me
Upon graduation, I am eager to contribute to advancing aerospace propulsion and furthering the journey of space exploration.

I am currently pursuing an Aerospace Engineering Major and a Physics Minor at the University of Maryland. I am currently working on designing and building a prototype magnetic nozzle with Dr. JAY at the University of Maryland, in conjunction with UMD's Space Power and Propulsion Lab.
