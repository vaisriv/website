# about

this website is home to my thoughts on anything and everything. it's not much of a [garden](https://indieweb.org/digital_garden), but i'm working on that.

i like a lot of stuff, and my interests vary greatly. currently, i am studying aerospace engineering at the university of maryland, with the goal of researching space propulsion.
